# Fairalyze AI: Tackling Bias in Machine Learning  

## 🧩 Problem Statement  
In the age of Machine Learning, biased training data can lead to discriminatory model predictions, worsening existing social inequalities. Whether in hiring, lending, or healthcare, these unfair outcomes are often undetected — silently impacting real lives.  

Despite the widespread use of AI, most developers and organizations lack tools to proactively identify bias in data or model behavior. Traditional statistical checks aren’t enough — we need ML-based detection mechanisms that can learn unfair patterns and expose them.

## 🔍 Example Workflow  

### 1. User Uploads Dataset  
The user uploads a CSV file containing tabular data with one or more sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, age).  

### 2. Protected Attribute Selection  
The system identifies potential protected features and allows the user to select which ones to evaluate for bias.  

### 3. Model Training & Evaluation  
- A classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) is trained to predict the target variable.  
- The model’s behavior is then analyzed across different demographic subgroups.  

### 4. Explainability & Feature Attribution  
Tools like SHAP or LIME are used to interpret model predictions and measure the contribution of each feature (especially protected ones) to the output.  

### 5. Bias Metric Computation  
The system calculates multiple fairness metrics, including:  
- **Disparate Impact**  
- **Statistical Parity**  
- **Equal Opportunity Difference**  
- **Demographic Parity**  

Each metric helps evaluate whether the model treats different groups equitably.  

### 6. Visualization & Reporting  
- Bias scores and disparities are visualized using charts (bar graphs, heatmaps, SHAP plots).  
- A downloadable PDF report is generated with insights, scores, and explanations.  

### 7. Fairness Recommendations  
The system suggests possible mitigation strategies such as:  
- **Data rebalancing**  
- **Re-weighting of samples**  
- **Fair model retraining** (e.g., with adversarial debiasing or post-processing techniques).

## 🎯 Impact  

### 🧠 Raising Awareness  
Helping developers and data scientists recognize how biases in data can silently affect model behavior.  

### ⚖️ Promoting Fairness  
Ensuring that machine learning models do not disproportionately harm underrepresented or vulnerable groups.  

### 🌍 Creating Real-World Impact  
Fairalyze AI is useful across sectors like:  
- **Hiring** → Preventing gender or ethnic discrimination.  
- **Healthcare** → Ensuring equal treatment recommendations.  
- **Finance** → Reducing bias in credit scoring and loan approvals.  
- **Education** → Promoting equitable admission systems.  

### 💡 Empowering Ethical AI Development  
Fairalyze AI makes fairness evaluation easy and accessible, especially for smaller companies or developers without access to large research teams.
